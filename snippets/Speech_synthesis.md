### Speech synthesis

Currently The SpeechSynthesisUtterance interface of the Web Speech API represents a speech request. 
It contains the content the speech service should read and information about how to read it (e.g. language, pitch and volume.)

```
function speak (message) {
  var msg = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(message)
  var voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()
  msg.voice = voices[0]
  window.speechSynthesis.speak(msg)
}
speak('Hello, world')
```
